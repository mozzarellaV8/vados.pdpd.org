# VADOS

I've been trying to find ways to deal with pictures of birds I take. This is the latest iteration - a static landing site, with images by date in a flatfile CMS.

The [previous (ongoing) iteration](https://universe-7.github.io) is a jekyll blog. The problem is that it gets updated slowly. Maybe I had more fun setting up the blog than writing posts for it. But really, it's that I shoot photographs at a much faster pace than I write paragraphs. 

The site is a general repository of images by day - sometimes multiple days. I'm happy with some of the images; others, I am curious about. Many probably won't make a final cut. But that's why they're there - to find out. 


# who?

**Vados** (ヴァドス _Vadosu_) is the older sister of **Whis** (ウイス _Uisu_), and is attendant to **Champa** (シャンパ _Shanpa_) - who is the _hakai-shin_ of Universe-6 and twin brother of **Beerus** (ビルス _Birusu_) - who is the _hakai-shin_ of Universe-7. 

**_She is a very composed and insightful individual...at the same time, she can also be rather mischievous, as she once intentionally instigated a fight between Beerus and Champa, as she made a birthday cake with only one Puff-Puff fruit on it._** <sup><a href = "http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Vados" target = "_blank">[1]</a></sup>
