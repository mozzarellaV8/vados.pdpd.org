Hi it's Pete. 

This site is a general repository of images by day. I'm happy with some of the images; others, I am curious about. Many probably won't make a final cut. But that's why they're here - to find out.

# who is Vados? 

**Vados** (ヴァドス _Vadosu_) is the older sister of **Whis** (ウイス _Uisu_), and is attendant to **Champa** (シャンパ _Shanpa_) - who is the _hakai-shin_ of Universe-6, and twin brother of **Beerus** (ビルス _Birusu_) - who is the _hakai-shin_ of Universe-7. 

**_She is a very composed and insightful individual...at the same time, she can also be rather mischievous, as she once intentionally instigated a fight between Beerus and Champa, as she made a birthday cake with only one Puff-Puff fruit on it._** <sup><a href = "http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Vados" target = "_blank">[1]</a></sup>
