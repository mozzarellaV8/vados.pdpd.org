Hi it's Pete. 

I started birding sometime around summer 2017. I'd taken a trip to Wyoming to see the Total Solar Eclipse. When I got back to New York, I decided I should explore - as fully as possible - what nature had to offer locally. 

This site is a general repository of bird pictures, usually sorted by day. I'm happy with some of the images. Others, I am curious about. Many probably won't make a final cut. But that's why they're here - to find out. 

I have favorites and tendencies. Northern Flickers, American Kestrels, Tufted Titmice, Cedar Waxwings...Piping Plovers, American Oystercatchers, Black Skimmers...Northern Parulas...each of these birds can take over my days out. Also: blizzards, dawns, and partly cloudly (33% cover) are motivational - blizzards especially as we seem to get less of them each winter.
